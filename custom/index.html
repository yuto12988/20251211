          <p>Christmas is an annual festival celebrated globally on December 25th to commemorate the birth of Jesus Christ. It is the central holiday for Christians, following the preparatory season of Advent.

While rooted in the Christian faith, Christmas is also a major cultural and commercial holiday worldwide, blending religious solemnity with cheerful secular traditions:

Core Traditions: The main activities include gift-giving, family feasting, and the setting up and decorating of the Christmas tree.

Symbolism: The exchange of gifts is inspired by the presents the Three Wise Men brought to the infant Jesus.

Festive Atmosphere: Homes and cities are brightly decorated with lights, and the atmosphere is enhanced by the singing of Christmas Carols and the legendary figure of Santa Claus, who brings presents to children.

In summary, Christmas is a time of joy, peace, and togetherness, emphasizing goodwill and celebration among family and friends.</p>
